Last year, my journal became a graveyard of my emotions—
grief, anger, loneliness.

Every page held a version of myself I wanted to escape.
Writing it down didn’t feel like release;
it felt like chains tightening around me.

So in the new year, I decided I wouldn’t journal anymore.
Not because I had nothing to say,
but because I was afraid of what my words would reveal.
I feared that if I wrote it down,
the weight would follow me.

For months, I refused to pick up a pen.
I refused to document the days,
to let out my feelings.

Until one day in March—without planning,
without overthinking—I found myself
buying a new journal.

I don’t know why.
Maybe because I felt something inside me.
Something different.

March 9th, 2025
The only sentence I wrote:
"I bought this because today felt
like the beginning of a new story."

The next few entries were scattered—
hesitant steps into a world I wasn’t sure I wanted to explore.

March 27th, 2025
The first words on the page:
"Where do I even start?"

Somewhere between then and now, I met a girl.
A girl who exists like the night sky,
pulling me into her orbit.

A girl who moves with the quiet grace
of constellations shifting.
She is poetry in motion.

Suddenly, I crave her.
I miss her when she isn’t near.
I love her in a way that terrifies me—
because it feels like she has rewritten
the language of my heart.

She is the kind of presence that makes the world
hum in a new frequency.
I want to spend my time exploring her,
unfolding her layer by layer.

Her voice lingers in my thoughts,
a melody I never want to stop hearing.
Her laughter stays in my chest,
a spark that ignites warmth in the coldest parts of me.

And her eyes... oh my god, her eyes.
They hold galaxies I want to get lost in.

She has changed me in ways I never saw coming.
Before her, I walked through life feeling numb.
Now, I feel everything.

The air tastes sweeter.
The stars seem brighter.
The world is softer, more poetic,
because she is in it.

I don’t know where this will go,
but for the first time in a long time,
I’m not afraid to write it down.`;
